- 👋 Hi there, I’m @Archivist-Ember
- 👀 I’m interested in Astronomy, Cooking, Literature and Games (Both TT/RPG and video)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data science post university to expand my skillset and apply my knowledge to Data Driven Astronomy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently, but feel free to reach out. I lack experience, but I'm eager to learn
- 📫 How to reach me .... lets's leave that for later while I get used to how GitHub works
